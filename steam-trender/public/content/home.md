# Welcome to SteamTrender!

This is a free and simple analytical tool that allows you to check the popularity of different Steam tags, their estimated revenue, ownership, etc.

Why tags? It’s simple. While a Steam tag ≠ genre (for example, _"Beautiful"_), some tags can closely define genres (like _"Roguelike Deckbuilder"_ or _"FPS"_). So, by examining the popularity and revenue data for these tags, we can loosely define the same metrics for genres.

This allows us to better understand current audience & developer preferences, essentially identifying trends that dominate current Steam.

Anyway, what are you waiting for? Check the tabs at the top!
