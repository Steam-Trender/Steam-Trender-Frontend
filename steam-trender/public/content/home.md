# Welcome to SteamTrender!

SteamTrender is a free tool for analyzing the popularity, estimated revenue, ownership, and other metrics of Steam tags.

Please note that SteamTrender is currently in _beta_. While we aim for accuracy, some features are still in development, and occasional bugs may occur. Your feedback helps us improve!

Why tags? It’s simple. While a Steam tag ≠ genre (for example, _"Beautiful"_), some tags can closely define genres (like _"Roguelike Deckbuilder"_ or _"FPS"_). So, by examining the popularity and revenue data for these tags, we can loosely define the same metrics for genres. This allows us to better understand current audience & developer preferences, essentially identifying trends that dominate current Steam.
